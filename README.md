# LeetCode Problems & Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode problems and solutions! This repo serves as a personal log of my problem-solving journey on LeetCode, documenting my approaches and solutions to various coding challenges.

## 📚 Contents

The repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels:

- **Categories**: Algorithms, Data Structures, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, Hard

Each problem contains:
- The problem statement (optional, for easy reference)
- My approach and thought process
- Code implementation in different programming languages (as applicable)
- Time and space complexity analysis (when relevant)

## 🔧 Languages

The solutions are implemented primarily in:

- Python
- Java
- Go
- C++
- JavaScript

More languages may be added over time as I continue exploring different approaches.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sushantbelsare/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```

2. Navigate to the relevant problem folder and check the solution code.

## 📈 Progress Tracker

To stay consistent with problem-solving, here's a quick overview of the problems I've solved so far:

| Difficulty | Solved | Total |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Easy       | XX     | XX    |
| Medium     | XX     | XX    |
